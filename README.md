Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The main idea for this project is a web page of my cat. The idea works for any person if you want, just change the content.
In the index view there is a short introduccion to Caroline: bootstrap with columns, an image and the navbar, wich is the same for all four views.
In the cities view there is a table with the information of all the cities where Caro has lived. The table was made with bootstrap.
In the hobbies view there are two bootstrap columns describing the main two hobbies that Caro have.
In the routine view there is an unorder list describing the steps that caro has every day.

images folder: there are the two images i used for the web site. The "descarga.png" is the icon for the page, and the "caro-2.jpeg" is the image used for the index view.

styles folder: there are the files for styling the web site. The style.css was generated with the style.scss.

views folder: there are the tree views for the page (index it's the main view)
